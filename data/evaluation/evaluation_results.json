The context states that \"models with higher complexity than necessary can suffer from overfitting and poor generalization, while models that are too simple will underfit and have low [goodness-of-fit]\" [1].\n\nThe context suggests that model selection criteria, such as the Kullback-Leibler Information Criterion (KIC), can help balance the tradeoff between goodness-of-fit and generalizability, or complexity, of the model [1, 2, 4]. By selecting the model that minimizes the KIC, one can choose a model that has good generalization as well as good fit to the observed data [1, 4].\n\nAdditionally, the context indicates that increasing the regularization parameter (ridge parameter, @xmath21) can decrease model complexity and prevent overfitting, although it will adversely affect the goodness-of-fit [2, 4].\n\nIn summary, overfitting can be prevented by using model selection criteria that balance goodness-of-fit and model complexity, as well as by appropriately tuning regularization parameters [1, 2, 4].",

The assumption that noise within all the hyperboxes is similar may not always be true, and the sequence of the training examples plays a role as well [1].\n\n3. The multi-level fuzzy min-max neural network (MLF) method does not work well for a high percentage of samples belonging to the overlapped area [1].\n\n4. There exists a new boundary region where the membership function generates very close values, making it difficult to assign a class with a high degree of assurance. The existing methods, including MLF, do not perform well in this area [2, 3].\n\n5. The training process for MLF and the proposed D-MLF method is not a single-pass algorithm, as the patterns belonging to the overlapped region need to be traversed multiple times to create the hyperboxes and overlapped segments [4].\n\nIn summary, the challenges include defining hyperparameters, handling noise and sequence of training data, dealing with overlapped regions, and identifying and correctly classifying patterns in a new boundary region [1-4].",

Specifically:\n\n- The maximum likelihood (ML) estimates can have large variance, making the unfolded histogram unintelligible to humans [1].\n- Regularization methods, such as stopping the iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm before convergence, reduce the variance by retaining some memory of the starting point of the solution, at the cost of increased bias [1]. \n- The regularization helps improve the mean-squared error, which is the sum of the bias squared and the variance [1].\n\nSo in summary, the purpose of regularization is to find a good balance between bias and variance in order to improve the overall accuracy of the machine learning estimates [1].",
